        - 12 months
    - How many Martian days' worth of data are there? (5 points)
        - 1867

- The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer: (30 points)
    - Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? (10 points)
        - Lowest temperature in the 3rd month and Highest in the 8th month
    - Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? (10 points)
        - Lowest atmospheric pressure in the 6th month and Highest in the 9th month
    - How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made. (10 points)
        - Approximately 675 as it completes one cycle
